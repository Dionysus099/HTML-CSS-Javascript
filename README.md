In this repository, you can find my files and codes I made during my course on Coursera based on HTML CSS & Javascript.

Refrence Sites I used in this Course:

1. http://validator.w3.org/ - To check if the HTML code is Valid or not.
2. https://codepen.io/ - Build, Test, Discover Front-end Code.
3. https://jsfiddle.net/ - A Code Playground.
4. https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110525/content-models.html - Content Models of HTML5
